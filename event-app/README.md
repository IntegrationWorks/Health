# Event App

This is a simple React application with a header and a Create Event page.

# React Event App with PostgreSQL, pgAdmin, and Solace Integration

This project sets up a React Event app with a PostgreSQL database, pgAdmin using Docker, and integrates with the Solace broker project.

## Setup Instructions

### Step 1: Docker Setup

1. Ensure Docker is installed on your machine.

### Step 2: Start the React Application

In the project directory, run:

```bash
cd event-app/frontend
npm install
npm start
   ```

Runs the app in the development mode.\
Open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) to view it in the browser.

The page will reload if you make edits.\

### Step 3: Set Up Backend Server

1. Open another terminal.
2. Start the backend server:

```bash
cd backend
npm install
node index.js
```
### Step 4. Start the Docker containers

```bash
docker-compose up -d
```
 The  init.sql file inside init-db directory has information of iitial SQL script.

### Accessing pgAdmin

1. Open your web browser and go to `http://localhost:8082`.
2. Log in to pgAdmin with the following credentials:
   - **Email**: admin@admin.com
   - **Password**: admin
3. Add a new server in pgAdmin with the following details:
   - **Name**: PostgreSQL
   - **Host**: postgres
   - **Port**: 5432
   - **Username**: admin
   - **Password**: admin

The `eventsdb` database should already contain an `events` table with one record.

###  Step 5. Integrate with Solace Broker
Clone the Solace broker project from the provided GitHub repository:
```bash
git clone https://github.com/mpirotaiswilton-IW/NEMS_Test_Harness.git
```

Follow the setup instructions in the Solace broker project's README to get it up and running.

Ensure the Solace broker is configured to accept messages from your backend server.


With this setup, your React Event app project will include a PostgreSQL database, pgAdmin, all managed through Docker, a Node.js backend server to fetch data from the database and serve it to the React frontend, and integration with the Solace broker for message passing.
